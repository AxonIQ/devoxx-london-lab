Axon Labs - Chat Application
============================

This project contains the source code for the Axon Labs. It contains two modules:

- *chat-getting-started*:  
  Use this module if you want to get a feel of how Axon works. The project contains a minimal 
  setup. You will need to implement the Command Model, the Event Handlers and connect the public 
  API to the command bus.

- *chat-scaling-out*:  
  Use this module if you want to take on a more advanced challenge. The project contains a fully 
  operational chat application. It's your task to change the configuration to distribute commands
  and events across multiple instances of the application.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask your Lab coordinator for guidance.

If you're stuck in the chat-getting-started lab, you may which
to have a look at the chat-scaling-out lab, since this takes a completed
getting-started application as its starting point.
